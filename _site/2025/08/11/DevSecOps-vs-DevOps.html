<p>The difference between <strong>DevOps</strong> and <strong>DevSecOps</strong> is basically the difference between <em>building fast</em> and <em>building fast but safely</em>.</p>

<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="1-devops"><strong>1. DevOps</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Deliver software quickly and reliably.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Focus Areas</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Automation</strong> (CI/CD pipelines, deployments)</li>
      <li><strong>Collaboration</strong> between Dev &amp; Ops</li>
      <li><strong>Monitoring &amp; Feedback loops</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong>: Often handled late in the cycle (e.g., before release or post-release).</li>
  <li><strong>Typical Risk</strong>: Vulnerabilities may be found <em>after</em> the software is already in production.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h3 id="2-devsecops"><strong>2. DevSecOps</strong></h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Goal</strong>: Deliver software quickly, reliably, and securely.</li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Focus Areas</strong>:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Same as DevOps <strong>+ Security baked into every stage</strong>.</li>
      <li>Shift security <strong>left</strong> (do it early in development).</li>
      <li>Automate <strong>security scans</strong> in pipelines (SAST, DAST, container scanning, dependency checks).</li>
      <li>Ensure compliance &amp; threat modeling are continuous.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Security</strong>: Continuous, proactive, automated.</li>
  <li><strong>Typical Benefit</strong>: Vulnerabilities found early → cheaper to fix, less downtime, better compliance.</li>
</ul>

<p>💡 <strong>Think of it like this:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>DevOps</strong>: Fast car, no seatbelts.</li>
  <li><strong>DevSecOps</strong>: Fast car, with seatbelts, airbags, ABS, and regular safety checks — and you still drive fast.</li>
</ul>
