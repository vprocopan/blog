**Folder Structure:**

1. **environments/** - Contains separate configurations for different environments.

• **dev/** - Development environment configurations.

• main.tf - Defines core resources for the development environment.

• variables.tf - Declares variables specific to the development environment.

• provider.tf - Configures the provider for development.

• outputs.tf - Specifies output values for development resources.

• dev.tfvars - Sets variable values specific to development.

• **staging/** - Staging environment configurations, structured similarly to dev.

• Contains similar files to define resources, variables, and outputs specific to staging.

• **prod/** - Production environment configurations, structured similarly to dev and staging.

• Contains similar files to define resources, variables, and outputs specific to production.

2. **modules/** - Centralized reusable Terraform modules, with separate folders for different resource types.

• **network/** - Network module (e.g., for creating VPCs).

• main.tf - Defines VPC, subnets, etc.

• variables.tf - Input variables for VPC settings.

• outputs.tf - Outputs related to VPC and subnet IDs.

• **compute/** - Compute module (e.g., for EC2 instances).

• main.tf - Defines compute configurations.

• variables.tf - Input variables for instance settings.

• outputs.tf - Outputs such as instance IPs and IDs.

• **data/** - Data module (e.g., for S3 buckets).

• main.tf - Defines data configurations.

• variables.tf - Input variables for bucket settings.

• outputs.tf - Outputs for bucket name and ARN.

**Purpose and Best Practices**

• **Environment-specific folders** (e.g., dev/, staging/, prod/) allow isolated configurations for each environment.

• **Modules** (e.g., network, compute, data) promote reusability by centralizing definitions for commonly used resources, allowing environments to leverage these modules without duplicating code.

This structure enables scalable, maintainable, and reusable infrastructure-as-code in Terraform, making it easier to manage configurations across multiple environments.
