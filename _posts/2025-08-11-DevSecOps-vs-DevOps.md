The difference between **DevOps** and **DevSecOps** is basically the difference between *building fast* and *building fast but safely*.

Hereâ€™s the breakdown:

---

### **1. DevOps**

* **Goal**: Deliver software quickly and reliably.
* **Focus Areas**:

  * **Automation** (CI/CD pipelines, deployments)
  * **Collaboration** between Dev & Ops
  * **Monitoring & Feedback loops**
* **Security**: Often handled late in the cycle (e.g., before release or post-release).
* **Typical Risk**: Vulnerabilities may be found *after* the software is already in production.

---

### **2. DevSecOps**

* **Goal**: Deliver software quickly, reliably, and securely.
* **Focus Areas**:

  * Same as DevOps **+ Security baked into every stage**.
  * Shift security **left** (do it early in development).
  * Automate **security scans** in pipelines (SAST, DAST, container scanning, dependency checks).
  * Ensure compliance & threat modeling are continuous.
* **Security**: Continuous, proactive, automated.
* **Typical Benefit**: Vulnerabilities found early â†’ cheaper to fix, less downtime, better compliance.

### **Key Differences in Practice**

| Stage        | DevOps Approach                          | DevSecOps Approach                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Planning** | Focus on features and delivery timelines | Include security requirements & threat modeling               |
| **Coding**   | Developer writes features                | Developer uses secure coding practices + linting & SAST tools |
| **Build**    | Automated build                          | Build includes dependency scanning & license checks           |
| **Testing**  | Functional and performance testing       | Also runs DAST, security unit tests, API fuzzing              |
| **Deploy**   | Deploy quickly                           | Deploy after security gates pass                              |
| **Operate**  | Monitor performance & errors             | Monitor also for anomalies, security alerts, and breaches     |

ðŸ’¡ **Think of it like this:**

* **DevOps**: Fast car, no seatbelts.
* **DevSecOps**: Fast car, with seatbelts, airbags, ABS, and regular safety checks â€” and you still drive fast.
