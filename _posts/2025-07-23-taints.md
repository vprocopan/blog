In Kubernetes, **`NoSchedule`** and **`NoExecute`** are two different **taint effects** used to control pod scheduling and eviction:

---

### üö´ `NoSchedule`

* **Meaning**: Pods **will not be scheduled** onto the node **if they do not tolerate the taint**.
* **Already-running pods** are **not affected**.
* **Use case**: Prevent new pods from landing on specific nodes (e.g., dedicated nodes for special workloads).

**Example**:

```yaml
taints:
- key: "taint"
  value: "special"
  effect: "NoSchedule"
```

---

### ‚ùå `NoExecute`

* **Meaning**:

  1. Pods **will not be scheduled** onto the node (like `NoSchedule`).
  2. **Existing pods** that do not tolerate the taint will be **evicted** from the node.
* **Use case**: Enforce stricter isolation, e.g., when a node is unhealthy or in maintenance mode.

**Example**:

```yaml
taints:
- key: "taint"
  value: "maintenance"
  effect: "NoExecute"
```

### Key Differences

| Behavior                | `NoSchedule` | `NoExecute` |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Blocks scheduling       | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚úÖ Yes       |
| Evicts existing pods    | ‚ùå No         | ‚úÖ Yes       |
| Needs toleration to run | ‚úÖ Yes        | ‚úÖ Yes       |

---

### Toleration Example (to allow a pod to stay on or be scheduled on a tainted node):

```yaml
tolerations:
- key: "taint"
  operator: "Equal"
  value: "maintenance"
  effect: "NoExecute"
  tolerationSeconds: 60  # pod will be evicted after 60s
```

Without `tolerationSeconds`, the pod will tolerate the taint **indefinitely**.
