Here's a visualization of your home network VLAN setup using the TP-Link TL-SG116E switch:

* **Router** connects to Port 1 (Untagged VLAN 10)
* **PC and NAS** are in **VLAN 10 (Trusted)**
* **Smart TV and IP Camera** are in **VLAN 20 (IoT)**
* **Guest Laptop** is in **VLAN 30 (Guest)**

Each VLAN is isolated from the others by the switch. Let me know if you'd like a config table export or wiring diagram with port numbers!
