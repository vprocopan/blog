Here’s a concise but deep rundown of **DevSecOps best practices** that cover the full lifecycle:

---

## **1. Culture & Process**

* **Security as a shared responsibility** → Dev, Ops, and Security teams work together from day 1.
* **Shift left** → Address security early in the SDLC to avoid expensive fixes later.
* **Security champions** → Appoint developers trained in security who act as points of contact.
* **Security awareness training** → Regular workshops to make security part of daily thinking.

---

## **2. Code Security**

* **SAST (Static Application Security Testing)** → Scan code for vulnerabilities before merge (e.g., *Semgrep, SonarQube, CodeQL*).
* **Secret scanning** → Automatically detect exposed credentials in commits (*TruffleHog, Gitleaks*).
* **Dependency scanning** → Regularly check libraries for known CVEs (*OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk*).
* **Secure coding standards** → Use OWASP ASVS or CWE Top 25 as baseline guidelines.

---

## **3. Build & CI/CD Pipeline Security**

* **Immutable builds** → Same artifact from build to production, no post-build changes.
* **Pipeline isolation** → Use ephemeral build agents, avoid shared runners without security controls.
* **Signing artifacts** → Sign Docker images and binaries (*cosign, sigstore*).
* **Security gates** → Fail builds if critical vulnerabilities are found.

---

## **4. Container & Infrastructure Security**

* **Image scanning** → Scan Docker images for CVEs before pushing to registry (*Grype, Trivy*).
* **Minimal base images** → Use distroless or alpine to reduce attack surface.
* **CIS Benchmarks** → Apply hardened configurations for OS, Docker, and Kubernetes.
* **IaC scanning** → Scan Terraform/Helm/K8s manifests for misconfigurations (*Checkov, KICS*).

---

## **5. Kubernetes Security**

* **Namespace isolation** → Separate environments by namespace, apply RBAC strictly.
* **Pod Security Standards** → Enforce non-root, read-only FS, no privilege escalation.
* **Network policies** → Restrict pod-to-pod communication to only what's needed.
* **Audit logging** → Enable Kubernetes API audit logs and send them to SIEM.

---

## **6. Runtime Security**

* **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing)** → Test running apps for vulnerabilities (*OWASP ZAP*).
* **RASP/WAF** → Add runtime app security tools or a web application firewall.
* **Process monitoring** → Detect unusual processes inside containers (*Falco*).
* **Threat detection & XDR** → Use tools like *Wazuh, Security Onion* for alerts.

---

## **7. Monitoring, Logging & Incident Response**

* **Centralized logging** → Send logs to Elasticsearch/OpenSearch with Kibana dashboards.
* **Alerting** → Integrate security alerts into Slack/Teams.
* **Incident playbooks** → Have predefined steps for breach response.
* **Post-incident review** → Learn from failures, update controls.

---

## **8. Compliance & Governance**

* **Security policies in code** → Store all security rules in Git (Policy-as-Code).
* **Automated compliance checks** → Regular scans for PCI-DSS, HIPAA, ISO, etc.
* **Versioned evidence** → Keep records of security scans and remediations for audits.

---

✅ **Golden rule**: *Automate everything you can, but make security visible so it’s part of the culture.*
