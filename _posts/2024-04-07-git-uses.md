# Git Use Cases and Documentation

## Introduction
Git is a distributed version control system widely used for tracking changes in source code during software development. Below are some common use cases and their corresponding commands.

---

## Use Cases

### 1. **Version Control**
    - Track changes in your project files.
    - Revert to previous versions if needed.

    ```bash
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```

### 2. **Collaboration**
    - Work with multiple developers on the same project.
    - Merge changes from different branches.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    git pull origin main
    git push origin main
    ```

### 3. **Branching**
    - Create separate branches for new features or bug fixes.
    - Merge branches when the work is complete.

    ```bash
    git branch feature-branch
    git checkout feature-branch
    git merge feature-branch
    ```

### 4. **Code Review**
    - Use pull requests to review and discuss code changes before merging.

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-branch
    git push origin feature-branch
    ```

### 5. **Undo Changes**
    - Revert changes or reset to a previous commit.

    ```bash
    git checkout -- <file>
    git reset --hard <commit-hash>
    ```
