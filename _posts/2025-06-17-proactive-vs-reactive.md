### 🚀 DevOps / SRE: Proactive vs Reactive

| Aspect                          | **Proactive Approach**                                              | **Reactive Approach**                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Incident Management**         | Set up alerts, run game days, use SLOs to predict issues            | Respond after outages or alerts hit production                  |
| **Monitoring & Observability**  | Implement Prometheus/Grafana, define thresholds, monitor trends     | Wait for users or on-call to report broken services             |
| **CI/CD Pipelines**             | Add tests, validate config with `helm lint`, use canary deployments | Push to prod without test coverage, rollback after failure      |
| **Infrastructure**              | Regular updates, apply security patches, autoscaling                | Scale manually, patch only after an attack or performance issue |
| **Security**                    | Enforce image scanning, secrets management (e.g. Vault + policies)  | React to CVEs after they’re exploited                           |
| **Backups & Disaster Recovery** | Automate and test backups regularly                                 | Attempt recovery when data is lost or corrupted                 |
| **Documentation**               | Keep runbooks, playbooks, architecture docs updated                 | Figure it out during an incident                                |
| **Cost Control**                | Use budget alerts, right-size resources, spot instances wisely      | Discover high bills post-facto and scramble to cut costs        |

### ✅ Why Proactive is Better (But Harder)

| Benefit                         | Impact                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📉 Reduces downtime             | By catching issues early (e.g., through alerting, chaos testing) |
| 💰 Saves costs                  | Efficient scaling, resource tuning, early bug detection          |
| 🧘 Improves dev velocity        | Fewer fire drills = better focus on features                     |
| 🧠 Improves root cause analysis | Known states and structured logs help investigations             |

### 🔥 When Reactive Happens Anyway

Even the best teams must **react** at times:

* Unforeseen traffic surges
* Zero-day vulnerabilities
* External service failures (e.g., cloud provider outages)

The key is to **turn reactive learning into proactive prevention.**

### 📌 Proactive Tooling Examples

| Need               | Tool / Practice Example           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| Monitoring         | Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager |
| SLO/SLA tracking   | Google SRE model, Error Budget    |
| CI/CD automation   | GitHub Actions, ArgoCD, Jenkins   |
| Chaos testing      | Chaos Mesh, LitmusChaos           |
| Secrets management | HashiCorp Vault, Sealed Secrets   |
| Cost monitoring    | Kubecost, Cloud cost dashboards   |

**✅ Proactive DevOps Checklist** with actionable items and tooling recommendations to help you implement a proactive approach in your DevOps/SRE workflow.

---

## ✅ **Proactive DevOps Checklist**

### 🔧 **1. Monitoring & Alerting**

* [ ] Define SLOs, SLIs, and Error Budgets
* [ ] Set up dashboards for system and app metrics (Prometheus + Grafana)
* [ ] Configure **multi-level alerting** (warning vs critical)
* [ ] Test alerts with synthetic failures (e.g., using `blackbox_exporter`)
* [ ] Alert fatigue review every quarter

### 🔐 **2. Security**

* [ ] Scan container images (Trivy, Grype, Aqua)
* [ ] Enforce IaC scanning (e.g., with `tfsec`, `kube-score`, or `checkov`)
* [ ] Rotate and audit secrets (HashiCorp Vault + ExternalSecrets)
* [ ] Enable RBAC with least privilege model
* [ ] Patch automation for known CVEs (via Renovate or custom scripts)

### 🚢 **3. CI/CD Pipelines**

* [ ] Integrate `helm lint`, `yamllint`, `kubeval`, and `kube-score` in pipelines
* [ ] Use canary or blue/green deployments (ArgoCD, Flagger)
* [ ] Include automated rollback strategies in Helm/ArgoCD
* [ ] Gate deploys with test pass, review approvals, and observability checks

### 🗃 **4. Backup & Disaster Recovery**

* [ ] Automate full and incremental database backups (e.g., with Velero, pgBackRest)
* [ ] Store backups securely in S3 or off-site
* [ ] Run restore simulations monthly (Disaster Recovery Runbook)
* [ ] Validate backup completeness with hash/size checks

### 💸 **5. Cost & Resource Management**

* [ ] Set up budgets and alerts in your cloud dashboard
* [ ] Enforce resource limits/requests in all Deployments
* [ ] Identify and terminate idle workloads regularly
* [ ] Use cost visibility tools (e.g., Kubecost)

### 🧪 **6. Testing & Validation**

* [ ] Unit + integration tests on every PR
* [ ] Validate Kubernetes manifests before applying (`kubeval`, `conftest`)
* [ ] Load test with k6 or Locust before major releases
* [ ] Include pre-deploy and post-deploy health checks

### 📓 **7. Documentation & Runbooks**

* [ ] Keep playbooks for all critical services
* [ ] Document every on-call incident and resolution
* [ ] Run monthly game days (simulate failure scenarios)
* [ ] Maintain an up-to-date architectural diagram

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 **8. Team Practices**

* [ ] Run regular incident postmortems (blameless)
* [ ] Track MTTR, MTBF, and alert frequency trends
* [ ] Ensure every new service has observability, alerting, and on-call docs
* [ ] Regular security and on-call training

## 🛡 **Proactive DevOps Policy Tips**

1. **"You build it, you own it"** → Dev teams own uptime, not just SRE.
2. **Treat infrastructure as code** → All infra changes go through GitOps.
3. **Fail fast, alert early** → Better to alert on degraded states than full outages.
4. **Automate for prevention** → Don’t script for recovery; script to *avoid* recovery.
5. **Document incidents like code** → Each one should improve automation or alerts.
