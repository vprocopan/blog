# Welcome

**Hello world**, here i'll be writing my prep for CKA

**If you forget the token to join nodes then do**
sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command

**storage-class-important-info**
the JSON format writes to the metadata annotations field. And in the annotations, you need to set storageclass.kubernetes.io is-default-class:true. If you don't have that, it's not going to work.

**daemon-set**
to create deamon set you have to run: kubectl create deployment deploydaemon --image nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > deploydaemon.yaml and change the specs of yaml file to:

apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    app: deploydaemon
  name: deploydaemon
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: deploydaemon
  template:
    metadata:
      creationTimestamp: null
      labels:
        app: deploydaemon
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
        resources: {}
status: {}
