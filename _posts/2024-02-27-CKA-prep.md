# Welcome

**Hello world**, here i'll be writing my prep for CKA

**If you forget the token to join nodes then do**
sudo kubeadm token create --print-join-command

**storage-class-important-info**
the JSON format writes to the metadata annotations field. And in the annotations, you need to set storageclass.kubernetes.io is-default-class:true. If you don't have that, it's not going to work.
