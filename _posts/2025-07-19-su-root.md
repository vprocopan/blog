Let's clearly compare the difference between:

### 🔸 `su root`  
vs  
### 🔸 `su -` (which is shorthand for `su - root`)

---

### 📌 `su root`

- **Switches user**: to `root`
- **Keeps your current shell environment**
  - Your `$PATH`, `$HOME`, `$USER`, etc., are mostly unchanged
- **Does not simulate a full login**
- **You remain in the same working directory**

#### 🔍 Example:
```bash
$ whoami
user

$ su root
Password:
# whoami
root
# echo $HOME
/home/user
```

💡 You're `root`, but using your regular user's environment.

---

### 📌 `su -` (or `su - root`)

- **Switches user**: to `root`
- **Starts a *login shell*** for root
  - Loads root’s `.bash_profile`, `.profile`, etc.
  - Changes `$HOME` to `/root`, `$USER` to `root`, etc.
  - Updates `$PATH` to root’s path
- **Changes directory** to `/root`

#### 🔍 Example:
```bash
$ whoami
user

$ su -
Password:
# whoami
root
# echo $HOME
/root
```

💡 You’re `root`, **and** using root’s proper environment.

### ✅ Summary Table

| Feature                      | `su root`                | `su -` / `su - root`         |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------|
| Switches to root?           | ✅ Yes                    | ✅ Yes                        |
| Loads root's environment?   | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes                        |
| Changes `$HOME` to `/root`? | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes                        |
| Changes `$PATH`?            | ❌ No (may miss `/sbin`)  | ✅ Yes (includes `/sbin`, etc.) |
| Starts login shell?         | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes                        |

### 🧠 When to Use Which?

- **Use `su root`**: when you just need root temporarily without changing your environment.
- **Use `su -`**: when running root tasks that depend on environment variables, root's `.bashrc`, or access to `/sbin`, etc.

## 🧪 `su -` vs `sudo -i`

|Command|Meaning|Key Differences|
|---|---|---|
|`su -`|Switch to root **login shell**|Requires **root password**|
|`sudo -i`|Run an **interactive login shell** as root|Uses **your password** (with sudo rights)|

---

### 🔍 1. `su -` (Substitute User)

- Starts a **new login shell** as root (like logging in directly).
    
- Loads **root’s environment**, `.bashrc`, `.profile`, etc.
    
- You must know **root's password**.
    
- Syntax:
    
    ```bash
    su -            # become root
    su - otheruser  # become another user
    ```
    

---

### 🔍 2. `sudo -i` (Sudo Interactive Shell)

- Simulates a **login shell as root** using **your user’s sudo privileges**.
    
- Loads root’s environment like `su -`.
    
- Uses **your password**, not root's.
    
- Requires you to be in `sudoers`.
    

---

### ✅ Summary

|Feature|`su -`|`sudo -i`|
|---|---|---|
|Requires root password|✅ Yes|❌ No|
|Uses sudo|❌ No|✅ Yes|
|Loads root env|✅ Yes|✅ Yes|
|Safer audit/logging|❌ Minimal|✅ Logged|
|Recommended for sudo-based systems (Ubuntu, etc.)|❌ Not really|✅ Yes|

---

### 🛡️ Which Should You Use?

- On **Ubuntu** and other sudo-based systems: prefer `**sudo -i**`
    
- On **older systems** or when root password is known: `**su -**` is fine
    
- For **audit and logging**: `sudo -i` is better (it logs who switched to root)
