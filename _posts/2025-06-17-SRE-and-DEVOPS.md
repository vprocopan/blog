A clear breakdown of how a **DevOps team** and an **SRE team** can coexist in the same organization, with distinct responsibilities but **collaborative workflows**.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 DevOps Team vs SRE Team – Two-Team Model

### 📦 **1. DevOps Team – “Enabling Delivery”**

**Goal:** Streamline software delivery, automation, and developer productivity

| Responsibility             | Examples                                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| CI/CD pipeline maintenance | GitHub Actions, Jenkins, ArgoCD, Helm      |
| Infrastructure as Code     | Terraform, Pulumi, Kubernetes manifests    |
| Secrets & configuration    | ExternalSecrets, Vault, SealedSecrets      |
| Developer tooling          | Internal CLI tools, boilerplate generators |
| Artifact management        | Docker registries, Helm repos              |
| GitOps enablement          | ArgoCD, Flux for declarative delivery      |
| Platform engineering       | Creating reusable templates and platforms  |

> **Mindset:** Make it easy, fast, and safe for devs to ship code

---

### 🚨 **2. SRE Team – “Ensuring Reliability”**

**Goal:** Keep services reliable, available, and observable at scale

| Responsibility            | Examples                                             |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| SLIs/SLOs/Error Budgets   | Defining latency/availability thresholds             |
| Monitoring & alerting     | Prometheus, Grafana, Alertmanager                    |
| Incident response/on-call | PagerDuty, incident runbooks, retrospectives         |
| Chaos engineering         | Simulate failures to test resilience                 |
| Performance tuning        | Autoscaling, load testing, caching                   |
| Capacity planning         | Forecasting usage trends and scaling needs           |
| Reliability tooling       | Tools that reduce toil (auto-healing, alerting bots) |

> **Mindset:** Measure everything and eliminate toil through code

## 🔁 Example Workflow: How They Work Together

### Deploying a New Service

| Step        | DevOps Team                                | SRE Team                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| 🏗 Scaffold | Provide service template with GitOps/CD    | Review SLO baseline for service       |
| 🚢 Deploy   | Build pipeline and Helm chart              | Ensure service is observable          |
| 🔍 Monitor  | Expose logs & metrics via Fluentd, Grafana | Define alerts for error rate, latency |
| 🛠 Operate  | Offer tools to update config or secrets    | Take on-call for incidents            |
| 🔁 Improve  | Collect deployment feedback                | Run incident retrospectives           |

## 🧱 Org Chart (Simplified)

```
Engineering Org
├── Application Dev Teams
│   ├── Builds features
│   └── Owns service code
├── DevOps / Platform Team
│   ├── CI/CD & GitOps
│   ├── IaC & Secrets
│   └── Developer enablement
└── SRE Team

## 🤝 Key Principle: **You Build It, You Run It**

SRE doesn't take over ownership — it **enables developers** to own production safely by building reliability into the system.
